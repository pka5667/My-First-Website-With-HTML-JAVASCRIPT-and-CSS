            <p class="font1">We’ve been cooped up for eight months as the virus slowly engulfs whatever dregs of normalcy we knew. For my three children, who are each under the age of ten, reinventing school and adapting to new ways to go about our lives had been fun
                and novel at first. They would wake with wide eyes in the morning and marvel at being able to do their math and reading in their pajamas. Bedtimes stretched later and later. And because we never knew what the grocery store would offer,
                dinner and snacks took on an almost adventurous feel. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>But as time ground on and the novelty of life upended faded, my children’s behavior began to get worse.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>At first, it was bickering. The kids snipped and snapped at each other over who got to eat out of the orange cereal bowl. No one could sit on the couch without a frustrating back-and-forth over whose spot belonged to whom. Even the toothbrush
                holder became contested territory.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>To be fair, my husband and I went through a honeymoon phase with the pandemic as well. We each moved our jobs home, making life feel cramped and awkward but doable. We, too, experienced later mornings and later evenings, and at first, we relished
                the minor changes. But over time, we found that spending every waking moment of every day was not exactly helping our intimacy. We got cranky.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Our family fell into a weirdly, uncomfortable new normal that included having to live with being constantly low-grade annoyed with each other. We got lazy with one another and words like ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ slipped further away from our
                daily speech. Getting through the day in one piece without someone having a meltdown became a goal. Without the release of taking breaks from one another, a luxury that school and work afforded each of us created a household of anxious,
                exhausted, grouchy people.
